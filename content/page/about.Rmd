My name is Jim Leach and this is my blog. I'm from the North of England, but I live and work in London. I love being outdoors, travelling, playing the drums, reading, and learning new things. I also enjoy photography: most of the images on this site are mine; you can see more on my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimleach89/).

I originally studied chemistry, but life as a chemist wasn't for me. I got a job and found my love of data and analysis. I was lucky to share this passion with my first boss and now [mentor](https://guerrilla-analytics.net/about-the-author/), who helped me find [resources](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) to improve my skills. I enjoyed learning so much that I decided to take a sabbatical and study for a masters in data science at [Imperial College, London](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-business-analytics/).

I now work as a data scientist applying scientific rigour to identify and quantify business opportunities using data. My analytical mindset; technical aptitude; tenacity, drive and communication skills enable me to use data to find and communicate answers to interesting questions. I write this blog to share my experiences, show my pet projects, and document solutions to problems I've worked on. 

If you're interested, this site is built on Jekyll and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jim89/jim89.github.io), where you can also find some the other things I work on. 

Welcome to the data gent - data science; in plain English.
