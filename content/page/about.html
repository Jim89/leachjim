<p>My name is Jim Leach and this is my blog. I’m from the North of England, but I live and work in London. I love being outdoors, travelling, playing the drums, reading, and learning new things. I also enjoy photography: most of the images on this site are mine; you can see more on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimleach89/">flickr</a>.</p>
<p>I originally studied chemistry, but life as a chemist wasn’t for me. I got a job and found my love of data and analysis. I was lucky to share this passion with my first boss and now <a href="https://guerrilla-analytics.net/about-the-author/">mentor</a>, who helped me find <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">resources</a> to improve my skills. I enjoyed learning so much that I decided to take a sabbatical and study for a masters in data science at <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-business-analytics/">Imperial College, London</a>.</p>
<p>I now work as a data scientist applying scientific rigour to identify and quantify business opportunities using data. My analytical mindset; technical aptitude; tenacity, drive and communication skills enable me to use data to find and communicate answers to interesting questions. I write this blog to share my experiences, show my pet projects, and document solutions to problems I’ve worked on.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, this site is built on Jekyll and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/jim89/jim89.github.io">Github</a>, where you can also find some the other things I work on.</p>
<p>Welcome to the data gent - data science; in plain English.</p>
