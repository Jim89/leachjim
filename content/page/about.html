<p>My name is Jim Leach and this is my blog. I’m from the North of England, but I live and work in London. I love being outdoors, travelling, playing the drums, reading, and learning new things. I also enjoy photography and you can see some of my photos on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimleach89/">flickr</a>.</p>
<p>I originally studied chemistry, but life as a chemist wasn’t for me. I got a job in tech and found my love of data. I was lucky to share this passion with my first boss who helped me find books, blogs, and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">resources</a> to improve my skills. I enjoyed learning so much that after a few years I decided to take a sabbatical and study for a masters in data science at <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-business-analytics/">Imperial College, London</a>.</p>
<p>I now work as a commerical data scientist and manager: I apply scientific rigour to identify and quantify business opportunities using data, and lead others to do the same. My analytical mindset; technical aptitude; tenacity and drive, and communication and leadership skills enable me to use data to find and communicate answers to interesting questions, and to empower others to do so, too. I maintain this site to share my experiences, show my pet projects, and document solutions to problems I’ve worked on.</p>
