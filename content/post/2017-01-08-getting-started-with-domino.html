<p>In this post I want to talk about <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/">Domino Data Labs</a>. Domino have built an impressive looking data science platform with some really cool features built-in as standard: collaboration, scalability, version control, and publishing (for analysis reports, data-driven apps and predictive model APIs!). I wanted to test out this functionality and see if I could get things working for myself in a short time frame. Long story short: I could, and I’ve been really impressed by what Domino can offer.</p>
<hr />
<div id="what-i-wanted-to-test-out" class="section level2">
<h2>What I wanted to test out</h2>
<p>I decided on two simple exercises to test out Domino’s functionality. One in <code>Python</code> and one in <code>R</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Create and publish a predictive model API.</strong> I created a simple classifier with the Natural Language Tool Kit (<code>nltk</code>) and deployed it as an API endpoint on the Domino platform.</li>
<li><strong>Create a <a href="http://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/204139569-Launchers">Launcher</a> to produce a self-service web form.</strong> I created a simple form that lets a user upload a text file of numbers (one per line). The launcher uses <code>R</code> (and the <code>knitr</code> package) to create a simple <code>HTML</code> report with some summary statistics and a histogram of the numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided on these two tests because, in my experience, both deploying models <em>and</em> creating ways for non-technical users to interact with data science products has been hard (without building a dedicated product). I also wanted to see how the platform dealt with both <code>Python</code> and <code>R</code> as I’ve used both in the past and wanted to see how Domino’s product handled them.</p>
<p>You can find everything I worked on in a simple, public project on the Domino platform <a href="https://trial.dominodatalab.com/u/Jim89/domino-testing/overview">here</a>. (This blog post is an edited version of my <code>readme.md</code> file in the project).</p>
</div>
<div id="text-classification-api" class="section level2">
<h2>Text classification API</h2>
<p>Creating a simple API endpoint on Domino turned out to be very straightforward. I decided to use the very simple <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html">example</a> classifier from the <code>nltk</code> book: classifying names as male or female, based only on the last letter of the name [Bird, Klein and Loper, 2009].</p>
<div id="creating-the-classifier" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating the classifier</h3>
<p>The code for this example was really simple. First, I defined a simple function to extract the last letter from a name.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def gender_feature(word):
    return {&#39;last_letter&#39;: word[-1]}</code></pre>
<p>Then, I read in the sample names that come as part of the <code>nltk</code> package. Usually this is possible directly with <code>nltk</code>, but I ran in to some trouble with the Domino platform not having the necessary data files from <code>nltk</code>, so I loaded the two files manually. I didn’t test out installing the <code>nltk</code> data directly to Domino (my focus was the API), but I can’t imagine it would be too much of a problem to sort.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>males = open(&quot;./male.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;).read().split(&#39;\n&#39;)
females = open(&quot;./female.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;).read().split(&#39;\n&#39;)
# Remove 0-length names (import errors)
males = filter(len, males)
females = filter(len, females)</code></pre>
<p>Then I created a single data set with all the names, labelled them as either male or female and shuffled that list up to mix the two genders in together.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>labelled_names = ([(name, &#39;male&#39;) for name in males] + [(name, &#39;female&#39;) for name in females])
import random
random.shuffle(labelled_names) </code></pre>
<p>The <code>gender_feature</code> function was then used to extract the last letter from each name, retaining the label for the classifier. After splitting the data into train and test sets the classifier (a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive-Bayes</a> model) was trained with the training data.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>featuresets = [(gender_feature(n), gender) for (n, gender) in labelled_names]  
# Then split into test and train
train, test = featuresets[500:], featuresets[:500]  
# Create a dead-simple Naive-Bayes classifier from the train set
import nltk
classifier = nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train)</code></pre>
<p>I tested the accuracy on the testing set, just to get an idea of how well it would work. (It wasn’t important to have an accurate classifier, but I was curious).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test)</code></pre>
<p>The model performed reasonably well, getting an accuracy on the test set of 76%. Not bad considering the feature used (just the last letter of the name)!</p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-the-api-endpoint." class="section level3">
<h3>Setting up the API endpoint.</h3>
<p>Following the <a href="http://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/204173149-API-Endpoints-Model-Deployment">documentation</a> on the Domino page also proved very straightforward. The first thing I needed was a function that would accept an input (here, a new name) and then use the classifier to predict the gender:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def get_gender(name):
    last_letter = gender_feature(name)
    gender = classifier.classify(last_letter)
    return gender</code></pre>
<p>I added this to the end of my script as per the instructions, and uploaded the whole thing to the Domino platform <a href="https://trial.dominodatalab.com/u/Jim89/domino-testing/view/get-gender.py">here</a>. Initially I tried to create and save the model as a <code>pickle</code> in a separate script. (The documentation suggests that can be sensible for large models that take a while to train). However my trial account on the platform didn’t have the right packages for this, so I kept all my code in one file. This felt reasonable given the simplicity of the model and the consequently very low training times. After this, I ran the code to make sure it worked with no errors on the Domino platform.</p>
<p>I then followed the documentations instructions for publishing the function as an API endpoint. I:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Selected <em>Publish</em> in the Domino menu</li>
<li>Clicked on to <em>API Endpoint</em></li>
<li>Added the file name (<code>get-gender.py</code>) of my classifier in the ‘file containing code to invoke’ box</li>
<li>Added my classification function (<code>get_gender()</code>) to the ‘function to invoke’ box</li>
<li>Clicked publish</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything seemed to have worked smoothly, so I tested out the functionality with the simple <code>Python</code> script provided:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import requests
 
response = requests.post(&quot;https://trial.dominodatalab.com/v1/Jim89/quick-start/endpoint&quot;,
    headers = {
        &quot;X-Domino-Api-Key&quot;: &quot;MY_API_KEY&quot;,
        &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;
    },
    json = {
        &quot;parameters&quot;: [&quot;Jim&quot;]
    }
)
print(&#39;The answer is:&#39;)
print(response.json()[&#39;result&#39;])</code></pre>
<p>It seemed to be working as expected, so I tried accessing it from <code>R</code> as well (typically the language I’d turn to first):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load the libraries we need
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

url &lt;- &quot;https://trial.dominodatalab.com/v1/Jim89/domino-testing/endpoint&quot;
dominoApiHeaders &lt;- add_headers(&quot;X-Domino-Api-Key&quot; = domino_key)
response &lt;- POST(url, 
                 dominoApiHeaders, 
                 body = toJSON(list(parameters = c(&quot;Jim&quot;))), 
                 content_type(&quot;application/json&quot;))
ans &lt;- content(response, as = &quot;text&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This worked as expected and gave my back an answer (which unfortunately I can’t show here, because my trial access has expired). Just to see how the API handled multiple requests, I created a simple <code>R</code> function to test out the endpoint on a small handful of names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Define function
get_gender_from_api &lt;- function(name) {
  url &lt;- &quot;https://trial.dominodatalab.com/v1/Jim89/domino-testing/endpoint&quot;
  dominoApiHeaders &lt;- add_headers(&quot;X-Domino-Api-Key&quot; = domino_key)
  response &lt;- POST(url, 
                   dominoApiHeaders, 
                   body = toJSON(list(parameters = c(name))), 
                   content_type(&quot;application/json&quot;))
  ans &lt;- (content(response))
ans$result
}

sapply(c(&quot;Jim&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Joy&quot;, &quot;Jake&quot;, &quot;Martina&quot;), get_gender_from_api)</code></pre>
<p>The answers weren’t 100% correct, but the endpoint was working as I expected it to, even with multiple requests.</p>
<p>The API creation functionality was fantastic and very straightforward: from start to finish I was able to get it working in about 1.5 hours (and that included time for me tinkering with <code>nltk</code> data files locally before getting things set up on Domino). Really impressive stuff and I’m keen to use this in the future.</p>

<div id="basic-stats-launcher" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic stats launcher</h2>
<p>Creating a launcher also turned out to be straightforward. I followed the <a href="http://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/204139569-Launchers#tutorial">example</a> from the documentation and got that working to get a better understanding of how launchers work.</p>
<div id="creating-a-script-to-run-in-the-launcher" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a script to run in the launcher</h3>
<p>The basic premise of a launcher seemed to be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a script that can be run on demand, with or without extra parameters that can be specified by the user.</li>
<li>Set up a launcher to use that script.</li>
<li>Add the option for the user to specify parameters to the launcher.</li>
<li>Edit the script to use the parameters, maybe add more parameters, keep going until you’re happy with the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was able to create a simple launcher with one parameter allowing the user to upload a file.</p>
<p>I created a simple <code>R</code> script that used this parameter and read in the list of numbers provided in the user-uploaded file. I made the launcher throw an error if the uploaded file had more than one column, as I wanted the functionality to be really simple.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the arguments from the launcher
args &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

# Get just the file (the first parameter)
file &lt;- args[1]

# Read in the file
data &lt;- read.csv(file, header = F)

# Throw error if more than one column
stopifnot(ncol(data) == 1)

# Set column names
names(data) &lt;- &quot;x&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="generating-a-html-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Generating a HTML report</h3>
<p>I initially tried to put this code into an <code>Rmd</code> file and use <code>knitr</code> directly in the launcher. However I couldn’t see how to do that either in the launcher dialogue, or in the Domino documentation, so I instead created a very basic <code>Rmd</code> file separately that had the text and code I wanted to use to create the <code>HTML</code> report.</p>
<p>I then added a command to for <code>knitr</code> to process this file to the end of my existing script. The actual command comes from the <code>rmarkdown</code> package, but this calls <code>knit</code> underneath to create the output from the code. This works because the when the <code>Rmd</code> looks for the data supplied by the user, it finds it easily because the code above has read it in to <code>R</code> already. (Which is how I got around not being able to figure out if/how to add an <code>Rmd</code> script to the launcher directly).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rmarkdown::render(&quot;./basic-stats.Rmd&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Rmd</code> file was very simple, containing some brief explanatory text, and the following code snippets to create the histogram, and a basic statistical summary of the numbers provided by the user:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create the histogram
ggplot(data, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, colour = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 30) +
  theme_minimal()

# Create the summary - use dplyr rather than summary() 
# for easy tidying into a neat # HTML table with 
# knitr::kable()
data %&gt;%
  summarise(min = min(x),
            first = quantile(x, 0.25),
            med = median(x),
            mean = mean(x),
            sd = sd(x),
            third = quantile(x, .75),
            max = max(x)) %&gt;% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c(&quot;Min&quot;, &quot;1st Qu.&quot;, &quot;Median&quot;, &quot;Mean&quot;, &quot;Std. Dev.&quot;, &quot;3rd Qu.&quot;, &quot;Max&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>I then tested the launcher and neatened up the HTML output slightly with a nicer theme. It seemed to be working as I was expected, which again was really nice.</p>
</div>

<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Testing out the Domino platform has been great. It works really nicely and I was able to easily create the two simple examples I’d decided on. End-to-end these two examples probably took only 2.5 hours to put together, starting from scratch and with no experience using Domino before.</p>
<p>I really like the way that Domino handles versions and change tracking. As far as I can see, <em>everything</em> in Domino is tracked. Files are tracked, running a file is tracked, and the output from a run is also tracked. Given how critical version control is, it was really encouraging to see this as a feature built-in from the get-go. The commenting and collaboration tools are also nice (although working on a solo testing project meant I couldn’t test them fully!).</p>
<p>Overall I think Domino is a great product with fantastic functionality, and straightforward to use, too. I think my ease-of-use experiences are a testament to both the platform (the functionality is pretty intuitive) as well as the very helpful <a href="http://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to using Domino again in the future. Especially for more complex and/or computationally intensive exercises. If you like you can check it out for yourself by signing up for a free trial <a href="https://trial.dominodatalab.com/signup">here</a>.</p>
