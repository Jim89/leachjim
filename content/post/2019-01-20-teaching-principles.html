description: "Some basic principles related to teaching (programming) that might be helpful that I picked up at rstudio::conf"
---



<p>I just got back from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf 2019</a>
in Austin, Texas. It was a great set of days with a <em>lot</em> of thoughts and ideas
for me to take away. As part of my time there I was fortunate enough to attend
the “tidyverse: train the trainer certification” workshop (so I’m now official
RStudio certified to teach the tidyverse, which is cool!). As part of the
workshop <a href="http://third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> (founder of <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software
Carpentry</a> and now a professional educator for
RStudio) spoke a lot about some general principles for teaching, and especially
for teaching programming.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, my enthusiasm is still coursing through my veins and the ink of
my notes is still drying. So I thought I’d capture some of the most important
ideas I jotted down over the course of the workshop. It’s not a well-formed list
for now, but hopefully some of these ideas will serve as good jumping off points
for the future.</p>
<div id="some-principles" class="section level2">
<h2>Some principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>No dead air - try to constantly keep the students engaged, even just with
chit-chat during down time.</li>
<li>Have a goal for a live class, distinct from what students could accomplish
themselves with videos or self study.</li>
</ul>
