description: "Some basic principles related to teaching (programming) that might be helpful that I picked up at rstudio::conf"
---



<p>I just got back from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf 2019</a>
in Austin, Texas. It was a great set of days with a <em>lot</em> of thoughts and ideas
for me to take away. As part of my time there I was fortunate enough to attend
the “tidyverse: train the trainer certification” workshop (so I’m now official
RStudio certified to teach the tidyverse, which is cool!). As part of the
workshop <a href="http://third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> (founder of <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software
Carpentry</a> and now a professional educator for
RStudio) spoke a lot about some general principles for teaching, and especially
for teaching programming.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, enthusiasm is still coursing through my veins and the ink of my
notes is still drying. So I thought I’d capture some of the ideas I jotted down
over the course of the workshop. It’s not a particularly organised list for now,
nor is it in any particular order. But hopefully some of these ideas will serve
as good jumping off points for the future.</p>
<div id="some-principles" class="section level2">
<h2>Some principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not your learners</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No dead air - try to constantly keep the students engaged, even just with
chit-chat during down time.</li>
<li>Have a goal for a live class, distinct from what students could accomplish
themselves with videos or self study.</li>
<li>Focus on <strong>active learning</strong> - keep the focus on the students, and keep them
active.</li>
<li>Nothing is as good as 1-1 learning.</li>
<li>Set up time for learners to connect and work with one another.</li>
<li>The format of your teaching materials should enable collaboration in the same
way (or as close to) as we enable collaboration with code/software.</li>
<li>Consider the audience, and match the materials and objectives of the lesson to
them.</li>
<li>Don’t test people <em>before</em> the are in the class, it may intimidate the less
skilled/experiences, and they are who <em>most</em> need help. (But level-setting
questions/quizzes once students are “captive” is probably ok).</li>
<li>The brain cannot form hard/long term memories after 45-90 minutes (and it’s
closer to 45), so make students get up and move around/be active to reset the
body and the mind.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what I don’t know</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Consider the three stages of learning:
<ul>
<li>Novice: no mental model to rely on</li>
<li>Competent: have useful mental models, and can do most things successfully</li>
<li>Expert: have elaborate mental models, and can handle anything</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mental models</strong> for how something works are <em>key</em><br />
</li>
<li>Have an idea of what mental model you want your students to develop.</li>
<li>The main goal of training is to establish good mental models in your students.</li>
<li>Mental models provide meaning to context.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Apathy can be infectious</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reinforce (even trivial, e.g. tab-completion) commonalities across
commands/methods/tools; this helps build confidence in new tools.</li>
<li>Consider the overhead (in time) of moving around a room/setting, and of group
work.</li>
<li>Call from people around the room at random, to try and keep the whole room
alert.</li>
<li>Get the audience active as quickly as you possibly can.</li>
<li>Consider common misconceptions, and deal with them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Authenticity is crucial - be yourself, only more so.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, your audience should come from a common team/organisation, so they
can help <em>each other</em> to put their learning in to practice.</li>
<li>Never go more than a few minutes without checking in with students (e.g. “does
this make sense?”)</li>
<li>Use sticky notes, coloured to code for:
<ul>
<li>“I’m doing fine, you can move on”</li>
<li>“I’m struggling, can you slow down/repeat”</li>
<li>“I need a break”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use sticky notes for participation - everyone gets one, when they interact,
remove it. Only interact with people who still have one left. Once they’re all
gone, everyone’s goes back up.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Start with a bang, especially after a break.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive load theory is important to consider - we need to reduce the
extraneous (distracting) and intrinsic (i.e. due to inherent difficulty) load,
and find ways to increase/enable germane load in students (the effort/energy
that is going in to encoding the material as knowledge/skill)</li>
<li>Break down tasks in to chunks to reduce the cognitive load.</li>
<li>Reduce the intrinsic load by communicating the <em>relationships</em> between things.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Very few things are as terrifying for a novice as a blank screen/page.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use faded examples during exercises.</li>
<li>Remember the limitations of time, and consider just how much you can cover.</li>
</ul>
<div id="getting-feedback" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Getting feedback is crucial, especially mid-session. Make sure you’re on track.</li>
<li>Ask learners what you can focus on (in terms of improvement), both negative
and positive, and actively work on what they say.</li>
<li>If someone doesn’t understand something, give them a <em>different</em> explanation.</li>
<li>Don’t waste student time - use formative assessments to check knowledge, and
skip material that they understand/don’t need to have covered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ideas-on-lesson-design" class="section level3">
<h3>Ideas on lesson design</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write down 3-4 sentences that describe learner “personas”, so you can tailor
material appropriately.</li>
<li>Draw out concept maps to help you plan what to cover, the big ideas, and how
they’re linked.</li>
<li>Write the final test/evaluation, the thing that assesses if the learning “worked”.</li>
<li>Create formative assessments (i.e. for in the session).</li>
<li>Write the materials</li>
<li><em>Save</em> the design somewhere, so others can use it.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to motivate students is to get them doing what they want to do,
immediately.</p>
