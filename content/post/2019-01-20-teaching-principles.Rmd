description: "Some basic principles related to teaching (programming) that might be helpful that I picked up at rstudio::conf"
---

I just got back from [rstudio::conf 2019](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)
in Austin, Texas. It was a great set of days with a _lot_ of thoughts and ideas
for me to take away. As part of my time there I was fortunate enough to attend
the "tidyverse: train the trainer certification" workshop (so I'm now official
RStudio certified to teach the tidyverse, which is cool!). As part of the
workshop [Greg Wilson](http://third-bit.com/) (founder of [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and now a professional educator for
RStudio) spoke a lot about some general principles for teaching, and especially
for teaching programming.

Luckily for me, my enthusiasm is still coursing through my veins and the ink of
my notes is still drying. So I thought I'd capture some of the most important
ideas I jotted down over the course of the workshop. It's not a well-formed list
for now, but hopefully some of these ideas will serve as good jumping off points
for the future.

## Some principles

* No dead air - try to constantly keep the students engaged, even just with
chit-chat during down time.
* Have a goal for a live class, distinct from what students could accomplish
themselves with videos or self study.
