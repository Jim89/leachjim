<p>Welcome to the first ever post of the data gent. If you’d like to know a bit more about me and this blog, check out my about page.</p>
<p>With introductions out of the way, I’d like to dive straight in and talk about a pet project I’ve been working on.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R language</a> and I’ve recently started looking at some of the <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">shinier</a> elements of the language from the redoubtable <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>. I’ve been playing with my personal data from journeys on the London Underground and I’m creating a simple web application to enable others to explore some of it.</p>
<p>I found getting to grips with the shiny-app framework really easy (note: I have no web-design experience whatsoever). Some lecture materials from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod">Coursera</a> really helped, as did the examples from the <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/">RStudio tutorial pages.</a></p>
I’ve managed to create a simple app with multiple tabs showing:
<ul>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;some simple summaries done with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ggplot2.org/&quot;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an interactive map of the stations I&#39;ve visted done with &lt;a href=&quot;https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/&quot;&gt;leaftlet&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a table of the raw data done with &lt;a href=&quot;https://rstudio.github.io/DT/&quot;&gt;datatables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>These second two packages are interfaces from R to JavaScript libraries, both released by RStudio. In short: <strong>they’re flipping brilliant</strong>. I continue to be astounded by the great work that company is doing for R, and for data science generally (in fact I might write a post about that).</p>
<p>For now I still have a few features I’m working on, so I’m not going to provide a link to the app. (Plus I’m too cheap to shell out for more than 25 hours uptime a month!). However over the next few weeks I’ll write a quick summary of what I’ve done so far (with some code) and then a couple of posts about the other features I’d like to add before sharing a link to the app - so watch this space.</p>
